fsync is a simple file synchronizer which transmits files over network.

*currently under heavy development*

fsync was tested only on linux. There are plans to porting fsync to windows.

LIBRARY REQUIREMENTS
====================
SDL_net
boost_filesystem
boost_thread (server)


BUILDING
========
Running make in the top directory will build both server and client.
If you want to build only server or client go to src/ directory and
run make. After that go to server or client dir and run make again.

RUNNING
=======
After building server/client/both a new directory called bin will be
created in the top dir. Then just run fsync_server or fsync_client
(depending on which one you've built). You can configure some variables
trough the configuration file but some vars are still hardcoded - if you
don't like them, change them in the source code.
